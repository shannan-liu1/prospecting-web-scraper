# prospecting-web-scraper
## Background:
If done manually, the typical process for prospecting on LinkedIn involves 4 steps: 
(1) enter a query to find relevant prospects;
(2) open a prospect's profile and scan for useful information;
(3) collect useful data from that prospect's profile; and 
(4) store that data somewhere. 

In this procedure, the bulk of one's time is spent on steps 2 to 4: viewing user profiles, collecting data, and storing the data.

This web-scraper automates those time consuming processes and thereby increases the efficacy of of one's prospecting workflow, resulting in a higher quantity of quality leads in a shorter time.
